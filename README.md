# Melodia
Melodia is a evolutionary serie without redundancy applied to sound frequencies.

##  Serie
- `level(time) = min(l), sum(i = 0 .. l + 1) { mul(j = 0 .. i) { prem(j) } } > time`
- `step(level, time) = (time - sum(i = 0 .. level) { mul(j = 0 .. i) { prem(j) } })`
- `mel(level, step) = sum(i = 0 .. level) { sin(π * mod(step, prem(i)) / prem(i)) / prem(i) }`

## Application
Sound frequency is computed as follow:
- `frequency = (2 ^ mel(level, step) * nbOctaves) * C0` with C0 = 16.35, nbOctaves = 10 and a sampling rate of 1/12.

## Implementation
It has been implemented in JavaScript and use [timber.js] to generate sound frequencies.
A node.js server has been added for hosting needs.

## Test
This project is configured to autodeploy on the [OpenShift `nodejs`] cartridge.
A running instance is hosted on http://melodia-betthefuture.rhcloud.com.

## Source code
The source code is available on [Github].
